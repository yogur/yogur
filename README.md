I'm a security engineer with a passion for building secure and scalable systems. My playground is the intersection of Application Security, Cloud Architecture (mostly AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è), and DevSecOps.

When I'm not architecting security solutions, I'm probably tinkering with code. I enjoy building things with Python and have a soft spot for front-end development with Vue/Nuxt.

Lately, I've been diving deep into all things AI security. My focus spans from securing production AI workloads to enabling complex agentic workflows with protocols like MCP. I'm also building my own AI agents ü§ñ with LangGraph to automate tricky security challenges.

I'm excited to start open-sourcing some of my projects soon. Stay tuned! ‚ú®
